# How I Accomplished Application of Concepts Taught Criteria
> In the HTML file, several HTML tags are used:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` - Document Type Declaration
- `<html>` - Root element
- `<head>` - Head section
- `<meta>` - Metadata
- `<title>` - Title of the document
- `<link>` - Link to external resources (stylesheets)
- `<body>` - Body of the document
- `<nav>` - Navigation section
- `<div>` - Division container
- `<ul>` - Unordered list
- `<li>` - List item
- `<a>` - Anchor (hyperlink)
- `<section>` - Section container
- `<div>` - Division container
- `<img>` - Image
- `<p>` - Paragraph
- `<h1>` to `<h3>` - Headings
- `<button>` - Button
- `<img>` - Image
- `<script>` - Script
- `<footer>` - Footer section
- `<nav>` - Navigation section
- `<ul>` - Unordered list
- `<li>` - List item
- `<p>` - Paragraph

> In the HTML file, the `<nav id="desktop-nav">` represents the navigation section for desktop view. Within this navigation section, there is a `<div class="logo">` which serves as the container for the website logo. Additionally, there is a `<ul class="nav-links">` that contains an unordered list of navigation links. Each navigation link is represented by a `<li>` (list item) and `<a>` (anchor) tag with an `href` attribute pointing to different sections of the webpage such as `#about`, `#experience`, `#projects`, and `#contact`.

> The `<nav id="hamburger-nav">` corresponds to the navigation section for mobile view, featuring a hamburger menu. Similar to the desktop navigation, it includes a `<div class="logo">` for the logo and a `<ul class="nav-links">` for the navigation links. However, in this case, the navigation links are hidden by default and can be toggled with a hamburger icon, which is implemented using a `<div class="hamburger-icon" onclick="toggleMenu()">`.

> Each section of the webpage, identified by the `<section>` tag, contains specific content. For instance, `<section id="profile">` comprises a profile picture, introductory text, buttons for downloading a CV and displaying contact information, and social media icons linking to LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

> The other sections, such as `<section id="about">`, `<section id="experience">`, `<section id="interest">`, `<section id="animation">`, `<section id="projects">`, and `<section id="contact">`, follow a similar structure. They include relevant content such as text descriptions, images, lists, and buttons, providing information about the user's background, skills, interests, and projects.

> Finally, the `<footer>` section contains a navigation bar with links to different sections of the webpage and a copyright notice. The navigation links are enclosed in a `<nav class="footer-nav">` and are styled as an unordered list `<ul class="nav-links">`. Each list item `<li>` corresponds to a specific section, and the copyright notice is displayed using a `<p>` tag.

> In the `style.css` file, I utilized various CSS selectors to customize the appearance of HTML elements. Broadly, I employed selectors targeting all tags, which have a global impact on styling. For more specific styling, I used selectors for individual IDs, honing in on particular elements. Additionally, I applied class selectors, allowing me to style multiple elements that share the same class. By strategically implementing these CSS selectors, I achieved a cohesive and visually appealing design for different elements within the HTML file.

> I used Flexbox for different divs and IDs so that the content of the website adjusts seamlessly when opened on a phone, laptop, or computer. Additionally, I implemented media queries, which can be found in the `mediaqueries.css` file, to handle this responsiveness. Media queries allow for the application of specific styles based on the device's screen width, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across various platforms.

> I incorporated animations in the emoji section of the website. The emoji becomes interactive when hovered over, changing its expression. Additionally, the eyes of the emoji follow the user's mouse movements, creating a dynamic and engaging effect. **However, it's worth noting that there's a bug in the mouse tracking feature, as it currently only follows within a limited area. I am actively working on resolving this issue to improve the overall user experience.**


# How I Accomplished Design Criteria

> In the HTML file, a `style.css` was created to design the HTML file. The `style.css` was then implemented in the `index.html` file. By targeting the tags used in the HTML file, I was able to change the various positions and designs within the HTML file.

## General Styles:

- Setting the global `font-family` to 'Poppins' and specifying fallbacks.
- Applying a background color to the `body` (`#F7E7CE`).
- Setting a smooth scroll behavior for the HTML element.

## Paragraph Styles:

- Setting the color of paragraphs to a shade of gray (`rgb(85, 85, 85)`).

## Transitions:

- Applying transition effects to links (`a`) and buttons (`.btn`) for smoother visual changes.

## Desktop Navigation Styles:

- Styling the desktop navigation bar and links.
- Applying a background color (`#5d5555`) to the desktop navigation bar.
- Styling the logo, links, and their hover effects.
- Defining styles for the hamburger menu icon and its animations.

## Sections:

- Styling common attributes for various sections.
- Applying padding, margin, and height to sections.
- Styling the profile section with flex and gap properties.

## Icons:

# How I Accomplished Content Criteria

> The website serves as a comprehensive platform highlighting various aspects of my professional profile. It is dedicated to providing detailed information about me, encompassing my background, professional experience, notable projects, and convenient ways to get in touch. To enhance user navigation and clarity, the website is thoughtfully divided into distinct sections, each tailored to showcase a specific facet of my profile. Whether one is interested in learning about my journey, exploring the projects I have undertaken, or finding the most effective means of communication, the organized structure of the website ensures a seamless and informative experience for visitors.

# How I Accomplished Creativity Criteria

>  To make my website stand out creatively, I played around with cool colors, fonts, and pictures. I wanted it to look interesting and modern, so I used different layouts and added things you can click on. I made sure everything looks good together and stays the same style throughout the whole website. The goal was to make it not just informative but also cool to look at, so people remember it.

# How I Accomplished Deployment Criteria
> I successfully deployed my HTML file using GitHub's private content feature, known as GitHub Pages. This allowed me to make my website accessible to the public. By leveraging GitHub Pages, I made my HTML file visible on the internet, turning it into a live website that others can visit. This deployment method provides a convenient and straightforward way to share and showcase web content.

# Insights that I gathered while accomplishing Lecture and Guided Exercises
> While completing the lecture and guided exercises, I have realized that web development is incredibly important, especially in today's age. A website serves as a platform to showcase one's skills, enabling better self-promotion compared to others. I've also come to understand that schools and universities typically teach only the basics. To become a proficient programmer in the future, I need to dedicate personal effort and strive to enhance my skills beyond the fundamentals. This involves learning how to read documentation effectively and using my time wisely to practice regularly, thereby refining my programming skills and logical thinking.

# Struggles that I encountered while accomplishing Lecture and Guided Exercises
> While going through the lectures and guided exercises, I hit a bit of a roadblock due to the overwhelming amount of information I had to grasp. Trying to learn three languages with different uses and syntax in a short time is a bit much for me. While the basic concepts are easy, the idea of reaching a high level of proficiency feels challenging and makes my brain ache with all the information. Nevertheless, I won't give up, even if I end up progressing slower than others.

# How I could Improve my Website

> To make my website better, I'm thinking of adding cool stuff like moving things or interactive parts to make it more interesting. I also want to make sure it looks good on both computers and phones. I'll keep updating it with new things I do, so it stays current. Plus, I'm hoping to add achievements I get in college to show my progress. And, if people give feedback, I'll use that to make it even better and more like what they want. Overall, I want my website to be fun and easy for everyone to check out and see what I'm up to!
