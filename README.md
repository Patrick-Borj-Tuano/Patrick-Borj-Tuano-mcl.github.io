- `<html>` - Root element
- `<head>` - Head section

- `<title>` - Title of the document
- `<link>` - Link to external resources (stylesheets)
- `<body>` - Body of the document
- `<nav>` - Navigation section
- `<div>` - Division container
- `<ul>` - Unordered list
- `<li>` - List item
- `<a>` - Anchor (hyperlink)
- `<section>` - Section container
- `<div>` - Division container
- `<img>` - Image
- `<p>` - Paragraph
- `<h1>` to `<h3>` - Headings
- `<button>` - Button

> In the HTML file, the `<nav id="desktop-nav">` represents the navigation section for desktop view. Within this navigation section, there is a `<div class="logo">` which serves as the container for the website logo. Additionally, there is a `<ul class="nav-links">` that contains an unordered list of navigation links. Each navigation link is represented by a `<li>` (list item) and `<a>` (anchor) tag with an `href` attribute pointing to different sections of the webpage such as `#about`, `#experience`, `#projects`, and `#contact`.

> The `<nav id="hamburger-nav">` corresponds to the navigation section for mobile view, featuring a hamburger menu. Similar to the desktop navigation, it includes a `<div class="logo">` for the logo and a `<ul class="nav-links">` for the navigation links. However, in this case, the navigation links are hidden by default and can be toggled with a hamburger icon, which is implemented using a `<div class="hamburger-icon" onclick="toggleMenu()">`.

> Each section of the webpage, identified by the `<section>` tag, contains specific content. For instance, `<section id="profile">` comprises a profile picture, introductory text, buttons for downloading a CV and displaying contact information, and social media icons linking to LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

> The other sections, such as `<section id="about">`, `<section id="experience">`, `<section id="interest">`, `<section id="animation">`, `<section id="projects">`, and `<section id="contact">`, follow a similar structure. They include relevant content such as text descriptions, images, lists, and buttons, providing information about the user's background, skills, interests, and projects.

> Finally, the `<footer>` section contains a navigation bar with links to different sections of the webpage and a copyright notice. The navigation links are enclosed in a `<nav class="footer-nav">` and are styled as an unordered list `<ul class="nav-links">`. Each list item `<li>` corresponds to a specific section, and the copyright notice is displayed using a `<p>` tag.



# How I Accomplished Design Criteria

> In the HTML file, a `style.css` was created to design the HTML file. The `style.css` was then implemented in the `index.html` file. By targeting the tags used in the HTML file, I was able to change the various positions and designs within the HTML file.

## General Styles:

- Setting the global `font-family` to 'Poppins' and specifying fallbacks.
- Applying a background color to the `body` (`#F7E7CE`).
- Setting a smooth scroll behavior for the HTML element.

## Paragraph Styles:

- Setting the color of paragraphs to a shade of gray (`rgb(85, 85, 85)`).

## Transitions:

- Applying transition effects to links (`a`) and buttons (`.btn`) for smoother visual changes.

## Desktop Navigation Styles:

- Styling the desktop navigation bar and links.

- Styling the logo, links, and their hover effects.
- Defining styles for the hamburger menu icon and its animations.

## Sections:

- Styling the profile section with flex and gap properties.

## Icons:

- Defining button colors and their hover effects.

## About Section:

- Styling the about section with flex properties and a background color.
- Applying styles to containers and details within the about section.

## Experience Section:

- Styling the experience section, including sub-titles and skill icons.

# How I Accomplished Content Criteria

> The website serves as a comprehensive platform highlighting various aspects of my professional profile. It is dedicated to providing detailed information about me, encompassing my background, professional experience, notable projects, and convenient ways to get in touch. To enhance user navigation and clarity, the website is thoughtfully divided into distinct sections, each tailored to showcase a specific facet of my profile. Whether one is interested in learning about my journey, exploring the projects I have undertaken, or finding the most effective means of communication, the organized structure of the website ensures a seamless and informative experience for visitors.

# How I Accomplished Creativity Criteria

>  To make my website stand out creatively, I played around with cool colors, fonts, and pictures. I wanted it to look interesting and modern, so I used different layouts and added things you can click on. I made sure everything looks good together and stays the same style throughout the whole website. The goal was to make it not just informative but also cool to look at, so people remember it.

# How I Accomplished Deployment Criteria
> 
I successfully deployed my HTML file using GitHub's private content feature, known as GitHub Pages. This allowed me to make my website accessible to the public. By leveraging GitHub Pages, I made my HTML file visible on the internet, turning it into a live website that others can visit. This deployment method provides a convenient and straightforward way to share and showcase web content.
